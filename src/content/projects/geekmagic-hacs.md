A Home Assistant custom integration that enables using affordable GeekMagic WiFi display devices (~10€) to show custom Home Assistant dashboards. The integration renders dashboards to images and pushes them to the devices.

Vibe coded with Claude - includes a nice configuration UX for setting up displays and dashboards.
