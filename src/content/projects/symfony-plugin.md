I created this PhpStorm/IntelliJ plugin to bring Symfony framework support to JetBrains IDEs - autocomplete for services, routes, Twig templates, Doctrine, annotations, and more.

As the project grew and I no longer had time to maintain it, I handed it over to Daniel Espendiller (Haehnchen) who had been consistently contributing. He has done an incredible job expanding it into one of the most popular PHP plugins for JetBrains IDEs, with 900+ GitHub stars and 3,700+ commits. The plugin ID `fr.adrienbrault.idea.symfony2plugin` still carries my namespace as a nod to its origins.
