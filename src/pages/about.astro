    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">About Me</h1>

    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
      I'm a principal-level engineer who ships products across the stack. I
      thrive in the age of AI-assisted development, leveraging tools to move
      faster while maintaining high quality.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">What I Do</h2>
    <p>
      My approach emphasizes <strong>breadth over depth</strong>—I'm comfortable
      across the entire stack, from infrastructure to frontend, and I focus on
      making the right architectural decisions rather than being tied to any
      specific framework or language.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      I bring a <strong>product mindset</strong> to engineering. The best code
      solves real problems for real users. I care about shipping, iterating
      based on feedback, and building things that matter.
    </p>
