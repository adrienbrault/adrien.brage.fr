    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">About Me</h1>

    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
      I'm an engineer who believes complexity is a cost that compounds.
      Simplicity enables speed. The investment in simplicity pays back on every future change.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">How I Think About Code</h2>
    <p>
      Code is a graph. Modules and functions are nodes, dependencies are edges.
      I care about <strong>software architecture</strong> — how things connect at the system level —
      more than the polish of individual functions. A messy function that's isolated? Fine.
      A bad abstraction in a core module everything depends on? That's the real problem.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      Not all code deserves the same attention. I invest heavily where impact is high:
      database schemas, core modules, type systems. I'm comfortable with mess in
      one-off scripts, frontend experiments, or areas where the design is still uncertain.
      <strong>The mess that matters is the mess that spreads.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Product Sense</h2>
    <p>
      Technical judgment without product context is meaningless. Every technical decision
      is a bet on what the software needs to do. I develop product sense by using software
      until it doesn't feel shitty, talking to customers directly, and understanding why
      priorities are what they are.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Current Interests</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
      <li>
        <strong>LLMs and AI tooling</strong> — Practical applications, structured outputs,
        developer tools. Building <a href="https://github.com/adrienbrault/instructrice">Instructrice</a> for typed LLM outputs in PHP.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Home automation</strong> — Building systems that actually work reliably,
        not just demo well.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>3D printing</strong> — Functional parts, not trinkets.
